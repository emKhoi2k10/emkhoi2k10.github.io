### I. Introduction
---
- So... what is the purpose of going to high school? In this post, I'm gonna tell you what I think about high school and what I personally think high school should be.

### II. What exactly is the purpose of high school in Vietnam?
---
- What the Vietnamese government thinks the purpose of high school is:

> Upper secondary education aims to equip students with civic knowledge; to ensure that they consolidate and develop the results of lower secondary education, complete general education, and acquire common understanding of technology and career orientation; and to create conditions for students to develop their personal abilities to choose their direction of development, continue higher or vocational education, or participate in labor, contribute to national construction and defense.

> (Law on Education No. 43/2019/QH14, effective from July 1, 2020)

- Damn, sounds very helpful and great for students, but wait, is high school actually like that in reality?
- The answer is absolutely not. This is why:

#### 1. Students don’t actually care
From what I’ve seen (and experienced), most students don’t care about what teachers are teaching because it feels meaningless.  
You sit through hours of lectures about things that barely connect to your dream.  

For example, in Literature, we’re told to “analyze” a poem’s structure or find the author’s “hidden message.” But brothers, by doing so, does that really help with my dream or what I REALLY want to do in the future? FUCK NO. Why? Because my passion is reverse engineering and cybersecurity.

#### 2. Prison
It doesn’t matter if you’re into cybersecurity, music, science, or art — everyone must learn the same thing, the same way, at the same pace.  
If you already know your passion, it feels like an actual prison. Every day you have to come to school just to learn things you don’t like, and those things aren’t even necessary. FOR WHAT? JUST TO FIT IN THE FUCKING SOCIETY.  
You want to *CHASE YOUR DREAM* and *ACTUALLY LIVE* — but instead, you’re forced to memorize stuff for an exam that doesn’t even test your skills.

#### 3. “Survive and pass the exam”
Instead of helping students find themselves, school turns into a game of endurance.  
You study to pass, not to LEARN.  
You dream about FREEDOM — about doing something REAL — but you can’t yet, because society demands that diploma.

#### 4. For people like me…
I already know what I want. I know what I want to do in the future. But instead of helping me chase that dream, high school just SLAPS ME IN THE FACE AND FUCKS ME UP. Why? In high school, I learn what I must, not what I want or need, so I only have my free time to chase *REAL KNOWLEDGE.*

#### 5. Here come the “high school builds your foundation” people
GUESS WHAT — FUCK YOU, DUMBASS. Y’all will say, “Oh, your passion is reverse engineering, so you have to take basic computer science in school to do that.” Brother, the *basic computer science* in high school **teaches** competitive programming and Python — bro, see? I already know that (I’m not good at CP, but I know what it is). Instead, why don’t I just straight-up take courses like computer architecture (how RAM works), assembly, and learn reverse engineering?

Of course, I did take and finish those courses about computer architecture and assembly on pwn.college. What I want to say here is, why doesn’t the government just ask students what they want to do in the future and let them have a chance to actually do it, instead of going to school every day for some nonsense?

SO, THE PURPOSE OF ME WRITING THIS, WHEN I HAVE A LITERATURE AND MATH MIDTERM TOMORROW, IS TO EXPLAIN HOW RIDICULOUS HIGH SCHOOL IS. I FEEL LIKE IT’S A SCAM THAT JUST WASTES MY TIME.

### III. My Only Philosophy of Life

> If you can’t chase your passion or do what you love in life, and instead have to do certain things just because the system says you have to — just to fit in — then what’s the purpose of living? You’re living to pay the price for something, like prisoners serving their sentences?
